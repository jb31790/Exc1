# 1. HTML Mastery:
## Basic HTML Structure:

- Create a basic HTML page with a DOCTYPE, head, and body.
- `<header>`:
    - Include a site logo or title on the left.
    - Add a navigation bar with links to "Home", "About", "Services", and "Contact".

- `<nav>`:
    - Create a vertical side navigation bar that includes links to different sections of your content like "Section 1", "Section 2", and "Section 3".

- `<article>`:
    - Add a headline for your article, e.g., "The Importance of Web Development".
    - Write a few paragraphs of content relevant to your headline. Include subheadings for different topics within the article.
    - Insert a relevant image within the article content.

- `<aside>`:
    - Include a small section that provides additional information or context to your main content, like "Related Articles" or "Did you know?".

- `<footer>`:
    _ Add copyright information.
    _ Provide links to social media profiles or additional resources.
    _ Include a "Back to Top" link.

- Ensure all the content is organized and well-structured, making use of other relevant semantic tags as necessary.

## Multimedia:
- Embed an image, video, and audio file into the HTML page. Ensure the video and audio have controls enabled for playback.


# 2. CSS Basics:
## Selectors and Properties:
    - Style the semantic tags you added in the HTML section. Give them distinct backgrounds, font sizes, and margins.
    - Use both class and ID selectors to demonstrate the difference.

## Typography and Colors:
    - Change the font family of the article to a serif font and the nav to a sans-serif font.
    - Use both named colors and hex values to style the text and background of different elements.

## Backgrounds:
    - Add a background image to the <header>. Ensure it covers the entire width and height of the header.


# 3. CSS Styling & Layout:
## Box Model:
- Adjust the padding, margin, and border for the <article> and <footer> elements.

## Positioning:
- Position a "Back to Top" button at the bottom right of the page using absolute positioning.
- Add a sticky side navigation bar that stays at the top when scrolling.

## Float:
- Float an image to the right inside the article, allowing text to wrap around it.


# 4. Flexbox & Grid:
## Flexbox Layout:
- Convert the main content area of your page to a flex container.
- Add at least three items inside and demonstrate the flexibility of the flexbox by adjusting the size and order of these items.

## Grid Layout:
- Convert the footer of your page to a grid container.
- Add four items inside and organize them in a 2x2 grid.
- Adjust the grid in the footer to stack items vertically on screens smaller than 600px in width.
